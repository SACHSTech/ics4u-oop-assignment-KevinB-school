## Summary of system: 
* The object oriented system I decieded to model was a system of a cash register at a small cafe. 
* The system preloads orderitems (menu) everyday which the workers can input all the parameters for each item such as the toppings, size, spesific type, calories and other things.
* The system then allows the workers to create an instance of the Order class so that each of the costomer's orders are saved in an array and the workers are able to add items to the order and perform all sorts of functions such as cooking the items, brewing, removing item, getting nutritions, etc..
* The system allows the workers to output the summary of the costomer's orders as well as the total and subtotal
* At the end of the day, the workers are able to pull the total earnings for the day/session through the static variable in the Order class.
